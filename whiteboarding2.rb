# Example whiteboarding problem: Write a function that takes in two strings and returns the longest common substring.
# Example input: "together", "bothersome"
# Example output: "ther"

# write a function that prints out each string
# write a function that prints out each letter of the first string one line at a time
# write a function that loops through each letter of the first string, and compares each letter to each letter of the second string (print "match" if the letters match)



# Write a function that takes in an array of numbers and returns a new array of the same numbers without any duplicates.
# Example input: [3, 7, 2, 7, 9, 12, 2]
# Example output: [3, 7, 2, 9, 12]

# write a function that prints out each number in the array
# write a function that loops through each number in the array and compare it to all other numbers in the array
