# Example whiteboarding problem: Write a function that takes in two strings and returns the longest common substring.
# Example input: "together", "bothersome"
# Example output: "ther"

# write a function that prints out each string
# write a function that prints out each letter of the first string one line at a time
# write a function that loops through each letter of the first string, and compares each letter to each letter of the second string (print "match" if the letters match)
